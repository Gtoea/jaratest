1.5mW = 2.05
2mW   = 2.75
2.5mW = 3.85

We are recording with the array centered in the middle of the well (ML)

All the way to 1698um without any sound responses - we may be too medial.
There are some responses to laser pulses


1502hrs - I flipped the array around so that I could get the electrodes more lateral in the craniotomy. The fiber is now in the approx center of the well. It looks like it might be pushed towards the shanks by the tissue though. 

I almost broke the probes like 10 times in a row. The shanks are remarkably bendy :/

1528hrs - I haven't found any sound responses yet. I am at 2399um, which seems too deep. However, the brain was bulging out of the craniotomy and so the zero may be off. 

Letting the electrodes rest for a few mins. 

I went all the way to 3000um and then started to pull the trodes back out. I stopped at 1383um to see if I could pick anything up. I am hearing laser responses - 2016-07-06_15-39-45


I am not seeing any sound responses, and there are few spikes. I am going to remove the array, let the mouse rest, and soak the array in trypsin to try and clean it. 


Mouse out at 1551, electrodes just went into undiluted trypsin
