I made new tetrodes this morning and attached them to a new optical fiber that was installed by santiago. The fiber now extends 6mm past the end of the cannula, and the tetrodes extend past that.

I then calibrated the speakers. The last two frequencies in the calibration set were not able to output at 60db SPL (with the voltage less than 0.5). The voltage for these two settings is at 0.5. 

I need to calibrate the laser and test the electrode impedence. 

Laser calibration

1.79 on dial, 2.3 on display, 1.08mW output
2.01 on dial, 3.5 on display, 1.96mW output
2.19 on dial, 5.0 on display, 2.99mW output


TT3 and TT6 are longest and the same length
TT4 and TT5 are the same length and 250um shorter than the others. 

Impedence measurementes
TT3 198, 71.8, 71,7, 244
TT4 170, 81.3, 81.3, 311
TT5 209, 298, 272, 397
TT6 136, 260, 152, 192

1431hrs - Mouse is on the rig and awake. Tetrodes are in the brain at 876um from the surface of the tissue. There has been some tissue growth, so our depths will probably be shallow. Fast spikes on TT6

Moved to 1145um, some spikes on TT3. Fast spiking like the previous ones. New spikes on TT6 that respond to visual stimuli. 

Moved to 1507um. There are spikes on TT5. Monitoring the channel, seems like it responds to visual stimuli. 


Strange clicking sounds from the ephys system. Large fast spikes that appear on all of the channels. 

1448hrs - at 2010um from the surface, No spikes but still strange noisy clicks.

16 frequencies between 2kHz and 30kHz, 4 intensities between 40 and 70dB, 0.1sec tones, 0.8sec isi, 10 reps of each. (640 trials needed.)

I can hear some of the frequencies when they are presented. THis could be because the saline in the wells is getting low. I wshould consider using agar. I am going to let this protocol run without messing with the mouse for fear of losing the cells. However, I should make sure the wells are full in the future before starting a protocol.
