The goal of this analysis is to generate the following plots: 

1. Firing rate PSTH in response to the laser pulses

2. Firing rate PSTH in response to the sounds

3. Raster showing the ability to follow a train of pulses

4. A frequency-intensity psychometric curve

5. Point clouds showing the laser off and laser on points

I also want to look a the spikes in response to different laser intensities and see whether the effect scales or not. 

The first thing that I need to do is figure out how to spike sort my data.
