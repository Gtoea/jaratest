1131hrs - mouse is on the rig, electrodes have been in the cortex at 1052um from the surdace for 10 mins. I am recording more posterior, still on the medial side, in the Right craniotomy. We should be posterior to the recording sites form yesterday

2061um, sounds like we are near the hippocampus. Lots of fast spikes, lots of multiunit noise

1136hrs - at 3000, waiting for a few minutes before movng to look for spikes. 

1142hrs - at 3100um, some minute spikes on TT6 if we lower the vis. threshold to 15uV. I will keep moving until I find spikes. 

1154 - 33460um, we see small but nice spikes on TT6. Not much sound response yet


by 3500um there are very weak sound responses. Moving to get better responses. 


at 3551um there are some responses, collecting more reps with 0.4amp noise instead of 0.3
Clear sound responses, good spikes on TT6. FIle = 2015-06-25_11-56-46

testing responses to 100msec laser pulses at 2.5mW. File = 2015-06-25_12-00-40
The laser response is very weak. Testing responses to pulses, file = 2015-06-25_12-03-22
Strange response to pulses, does not look good, moving another 50um

at 3601um, good responses to noise bursts at 0.3amp. File = 2015-06-25_12-13-38
Testing responses to laser pulses at 2.5mW. File = 2015-06-25_12-15-58
No responses to the laser. Trying pulses at 3mW. File = 2015-06-25_12-18-50
No response to the laser. Moving deeper. 


at 3650um, recording noise bursts. File = 2015-06-25_12-23-21
Strong sound responses. Testing with laser pulses at 2.5mW. File = 2015-06-25_12-26-09
No laser responses. We are going to record from the other well now. 

We moved to a site in the center (A-P) medial area of the left well. I coated the elecrodes with some DiI before inserting them. We are currently at 1112um from the surface. The growth on the top was pretty thick, so I suspect all of our distances will be shallow. There seem to be some background noises when moving the light

At 1264 there is a lot of activity

2182um, lots of activity. Hippocampus?

By 2537 it is quiet again

at 2784 there are spikes on TT6, testing sound responses - Not sound responsive
2955um, large spikes on TT6
3150 - really fast spikes on TT6
3250, tons of spikes on TT3 and TT6, no sound responses
3650, lots of really fast spikes on all the tetrodes. No sound responses
4206, cant get away from these really fast spikes. Ending the experiment
