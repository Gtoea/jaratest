1358 - 912um - electrodes are in the brain and the mouse is awake. multi-unit visual responses to the light. 



962um - spikes on TT4

1100 - just pushed through a cell layer

1304 - large spikes on TT5

1455 - tons of spikes

1600 - spikes are gone on TT5

2000 - spikes again on TT5. I am going to let the brain rest. 

2500um - large (large) bursts of activity

3000um - laser responses with long latency - likely visual responses

3900um - there are no sound responses. I think I am too anterior. I am going to remove the electrodes. The mouse is somewhat freaked out. I am going to take him off and let him get some rest
