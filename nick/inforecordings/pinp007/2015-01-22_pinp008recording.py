''' I cant find anything, so I am marking locations and I am going to perfuse this mouse.

First mark is the front (ap) and center(ml) of the AC well. I tried to zero at the surface and then advance 1500um. I think that most of the dv movement was slippiing against the cortical surface, so I am not sure how deep I actually was able to go.

Second mark is the back (ap) center of the AC well. Both of these were about at where I think the ridge would be, although I should do some better controlled injections to make sure. Also went to 1500 but same issue applies as above. 


Third mark is in the center of the thalamus craniotomy, although slightly medial and posterior of the exact center due to the way the electrodes flexed and the tissue separated. I am goin to 3200um. 

activity at 1700 consistent with usual recordings. no sound responses at 3200um. No neural activity really either. My electrodes are not as good today, so that could be part of the problem.
