'''
 653um - tetrodes are in the Right thalamus as posterior as possible, although slightly medial of the center of the craniotomy.

975um - spikes that respond to the flashlight on TT4

1550 - spikes on TT5
 
1950um - silence again

2850 - spikes on TT5 - testing sound response

3250um - no sound responses yet.

3708um - freakin visual responses to the laser. 

I am going to extend the craniotomy more posterior

After extending the craniotomy and inserting the electrodes farther posterior, the experiment continues

1022um - electrodes have been settling for 10 mins, No responses here but there could have been significant cortical damage. 

No tmuch activity on the way down

2014um - some spikes on TT3 (shallow electrode)

3600um - still visual responses to the laser

4400um - nothing here.

I am going to remove the electrodes and do surgery on this mouse this afternoon to implant a well over auditory cortex.
