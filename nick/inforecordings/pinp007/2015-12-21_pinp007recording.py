1429 - 611um, mouse is waking up on the rig. Tetrodes are in the medial posterior location of the right well, covered in DiI. This will be my last recording with this animal. 


14-52-47 - laser pulses outside the brain - visual test. Clear visual responses on TT4 and 6

963um - large spikes on TT4
1124um - now picking up the spikes on TT5, TT4 and 6 are quiet
1496um - lots of activity on TT4
1708um - activity on TT4 is gone, some still on TT6
1802um - activity os now on TT5
2000um - giving the brain a chance to rest for a few mins, no more activity on any channel

2239um - non-sound-responsive neurons on TT4

2832um - very quiet

3000um - giving the brain another rest



 3630um - I am hearing field responses to laser pulses, but I do not have any good spikes on any tetrode
15-23-40 - long latency (100msec) laser responses on TT4


3902um - some spikes on TT6
15-30-17 - no sound responses to 60dB noise bursts


4094um - lots of spikes on TT4, but no responses to sound


4200um - no sound responses. I am going to stop and sacrifice this mouse.
