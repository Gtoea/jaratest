09:19:49 - Anaesthesia on at 3%
09:25:44 - Mouse in box, anaesthesia reduced to 1%
09:48:10 - Electrodes zeroed at brain surface

10:02:34 - Mouse is awake, holding at 1350um for 2 mins
10:04:15 - Cells on TT2 at 1500um
10:06:19 - Stongger signals on TT2, very narrow. 
10:11:19 - Playing 100msec bursts of noise now. Still oly have cells on TT2, but there are a lot of spikes. See what may be 2 clusters, 2000um. There were several sounds that could indicate cell death on the way down to this depth from 1500 um. 
10:13:13 - 2100um, I am now seeing cells on TT4
10:15:25 - 2200um, Very large signals on TT21
10:16:55 - 2300um, large signals are gone from TT2
10:21:12 - 2450um, large signals on TT2
10:33:31 - 2560 Have bben holding for 5 
mins, signals on TT2 are fading.
