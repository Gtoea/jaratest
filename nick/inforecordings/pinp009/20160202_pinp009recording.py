Thalamus recording


In the medial side of the well near the middle AP

FS neuron activity on TT6 at 1812um

 at 3535um there are great sound responses, no laser responses yet. I am going to record a short AM tuning curve out of curiosity

file = 16-07-33
behav = a

visual responses to the laser at this site

all the way to 3900 without laser responses.
