Recording from the thalamus

some spikes near 1000

some spikes on longest TT at 1700um

Data file 2016-02-01_16-06-34 was recorded with noise bursts and the new open ephys, but it saves the files differently so I will have to figure out how to load them. 

I got all the way to 3600 without seeing good laser-evoked responses. I was aiming for the medial posterior location in the well. I think I am going to take the electrodes out and do a cortex recording


New recording - cortex


Tetrodes at 789um


The electrical noise is very bad. I think I need to make a better ground wire
