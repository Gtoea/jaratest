* comparisonplots.py: Produces a plot of pupil area, averaged across
trials that are locked to played sounds.  The trials are plotted by
condition, such that sound change trials are grouped into identical frequencies.
* facemapanalysis.py: Module for loading and preprocessing FaceMap data.
The module loads processed FaceMap data, and generates traces of pupil
area, experiment synchronization light, and mouse behaviors such as
whisking and running.
