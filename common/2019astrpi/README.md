README file contains instructions for processing data and generating figures
#Here is the readme place we will place codes for the paper


We will create total 7 categories of files

1. README.md
2. database_generate //combine
3. database_generate_funcs
4. study params
5. figure params
6. [generate] data for figures
7. [figure] generation
8. generate reports/stat results


General:

    where statistics are calculated
        if in figures, indicate which script produces stats in question
    decisions made in data analysis (e.g. excluded trials)
        put in generate scripts that carry out these decisions

Generates:

    include code used for clustering/spike sorting
    indicate scripts used to generate databases

Figures:

    indicate script that produces figure, how to run
    for each panel, indicate location of data being shown
    for each panel, indicate generate script that produces data shown, how to run
