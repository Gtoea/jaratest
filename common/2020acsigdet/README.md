# Figures
All figures require access to the behaviour data and `studyparams.py`, which contains a list of all the mice and sessions associated with each experiment.

## Figure 1 (Behaviour summary without manipulation)
This figure is produced by running `figure_behav_performance.py`.

### Panel A
This panel has a cartoon of a mouse performing the tone detection task, created in Inkscape.
### Panel B
This panel has a cartoon of the stimuli used during the tone detection task, created in Inkscape.
### Panel C
This panel has an example psychometric curve from one session from one mouse, with the data only split by SNR. This requires the file `band068_unimplanted_psycurve.npz`, which is created by running `generate_behav_performance.py`.
### Panel D,E,F
These panels show summaries of psychometric curves, accuracies, and biases in all mice trained in the task. This requires the file `unimplanted_behaviour.npz`, created by running `generate_behav_performance.py`.

## Figure 2 (Effect on behaviour of inactivating AC)
This figure is produced by running `figure_ac_inactivation.py`.

### Panel A
This panel has a cartoon of the the mouse performing the task with laser stimulation, created in Inkscape.
### Panel B
This panel has an example psychometric curve for one mouse, with the data pooled across all experimental sessions, split by SNR, and only showing data for 0.25 octaves. This requires the file `band046_psycurve.npz`, created by running `generate_ac_inactivation_examples.py`.
### Panel C,D
These panels show summaries of changes in accuracy and bias with laser inactivation. This requires the files `all_behaviour_ac_inactivation.npz` (generated by running `generate_ac_inactivation.py`) and `all_behaviour_ac_inactivation_control.npz` (generated by running `supplement_generate_control_ac_inactivation.py`).
### Panel E,G
These panels show example distributions of center port dwell times and travel times from the center to reward port. This requires the file `band046_reaction_times.npz`, generated by running `generate_ac_inactivation_reaction_examples.py`.
### Panel F,H
These panels show summaries of change in sampling time and reward collection time with laser inactivation. This requires the file `all_reaction_times_ac_inactivation.npz`, generated by running `generate_ac_inactivation_reaction_times.py`.

## Figure 3 (Effect on behaviour of inactivating PV/SOM by bandwidth)
This figure is produced by running `figure_inhib_inactivation.py`.

### Panel A,D
These panels show example psychometric curves from one PV-ArchT and SOM-ArchT mouse, with data pooled across all experimental sessions, split by SNR, and only showing data for 0.25 octaves. This requires the files `band065_psycurve.npz` and `band081_psycurve.npz`, generated by running `generate_inhib_inactivation_examples.py`.
### Panel G
This panel has a cartoon of the the mouse performing the task with laser stimulation, created in Inkscape.
### Panel B,C,E,F,H,I
These panels show summaries of changes in accuracy and bias with laser stimulation. This requires the files `all_behaviour_inhib_inactivation.npz` (generated by running `generate_inhib_inactivation.py`) and `all_behaviour_inhib_inactivation_control.npz` (generated by running `supplement_generate_inhib_inactivation_control.py`).

## Figure X (Effect on behaviour of inactivating PV/SOM by SNR)
This figure is produced by running `supplement_figure_inhib_effect_by_snr.py`

This figures shows changes in psychometric curves with laser inactivation. This requires the file `change_behaviour_by_snr_inhib_inactivation_v2.npz`, generated by running `generate_inhib_effect_by_snr_v2.py`.
