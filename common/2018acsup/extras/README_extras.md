# Figures
Most figures require access to the databases (`photoidentification_cells.h5` and `inactivation_cells.h5`), the clustered ephys data, the behaviour data, and the .npz files produced by the main generate files.

## ArchT histology
This figure is one of the figures sent during the appeal, and depicts two example brain slices showing the extent of ArchT transfection in a PV-Cre and SOM-Cre mouse. This figure is produced by running `archt_transfection.py`.

### Panel A,D
These panels have a cartoon of a circuit consisting of an Excitatory, PV, and SOM cell, and showing the laser and recording electrode, created in Inkscape.
### Panel G
This panel has an example histology image with boundaries between auditory areas drawn in Inkscape. The image is `band055_outlines.jpg`, located on jarahub in /data/figuresdata/2018acsup/supplement_figure_histology.
### All other panels
These panels are generated by the figure script using data generated by `supplement_generate_photoidentification.py`.
