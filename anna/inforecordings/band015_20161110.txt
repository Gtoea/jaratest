probe: 7752 (three-dots)

Recording from right AC, somewhat close to medial edge. Probes coated with DiD.

At 500um, slowly moving down.

At 750um, still nothing, probes appear intact in scope. LFP pretty quiet, probably because of relatively high impedance of new probe.

At 900um, starting to see something on TT2 and 8!

At 980um, definite spikes on TT2, though small and shitty.

At 1060um, starting to pick up signals on TT6 and 7 as well, but still shit.

At 1090, good spikes on TT2! Something on TT6,8 as well.
Doesn't look sound responsive (noise from mouse jumping?) No laser response.

At 1175um, more spikes on TT2.
Sound response on TT2! Possible off laser response, but very hard to tell with all the noise.

At 1225um, spikes on TT2 and 6.
Looks like a sound response on TT2. Looks like laser off response?
Testing tuning because why not at this point. TT2 likes 15kHz, 64Hz mod.

At 1275um, new spikes on TT6, possibly same ones on TT2.
Only TT2 sound responsive, and I think those are the same cells.

At 1325, some damn good spikes on TT2, maybe something on TT6.
TT2 sound responsive. Looks like a laser off response.
TT2 has pretty similar response to before (15kHz, 64Hz mod). TT6 weakly sound responsive, but likes 26kHz.

At 1400, great spikes on TT6, decent ones on TT2,8.
Strong sound response on TT2, weak one on TT6. Laser off response.
14kHz, 64Hz mod for TT2.

At 1450um, decent spikes on TT2,6,8.
Same old TT2 response, but new sound response on TT8.
Still just laser off response.

At 1500um, spikes on TT1,2,5,6,8, possibly 4?
TT1,2,6 sound responsive. Possible TT8 laser response?

Move to 1510um to maybe get closer to TT8 cell? Also spikes on TT7.
MAYBE laser response on TT8. Might as well go for it.
TT8 likes 22kHz and 32Hz mod, checking laser again to see if response still there.
Hard to say... trying a laser train.
Seems unlikely... but might as well record somewhat interesting TT8 response.
