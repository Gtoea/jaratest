probe: 92B1 (three-shanks), now with optical fiber!

We are recording from right AC with probes near lateral edge of craniotomy. Probes and fiber coated with DiI.

At 916um, moving down, looking for neurons.

At 981um, maybe spikes on TT2,4,6. TT6 laser responsive. Responses going away and spike shape is quite crappy, maybe try moving closer?

At 992um, some improvement in TT6 spikes. Much improved laser response (and better inhibitory laser response on TT4). Checking sound response.
All tetrodes sound responsive, TT6 looks like it has onset/inhibitory response (multiple cells?)
TT2 likes 26kHz but suppressed by AM, TT4 loves 40kHz and very sustained response to 4Hz am, TT6 likes 18kHz and hates 4Hz mod the least.
Going with 18kHz, 4Hz for TT6 cell, as it's the only laser responsive one.

At 1030um, pretty nice spikes on TT2,4, mediocre ones on TT6.
TT6 hardcore laser response, TT2 and 4 suppressed by laser. Maybe we didn't move far enough away and these are the same cells? But their waveforms are better, so let's go with it.
Sound responses look much the same as before. Unfortunately, I don't give a fuck.
Yeah, these are definitely the same cells. Going with 18kHz, 8Hz mod.

At 1092, really good spikes on TT2,4, ok on 6.
Possible laser responses on all three tetrodes, not as sexy as before.
Something appeared on TT3 during recording, making new site since we were referencing TT3.
Okay, that's a TT4 response. And the TT4 spikes are large and in charge!
TT4 sound response is kinda weird/barely there, but barely there is all I need. TT2 also sound responsive.
TT4 really likes 26-32kHz, hates white noise. All others irrelevant.

At 1150um, pretty good spikes on TT1,2,3,4,6. Still got that TT4 laser response, same cells?
Compared to laser responses from previous site... these are the same cells. Moving on.

At 1200um, good signals again on TT1,2,4,5,6.
TT2 and 4 laser responsess still look the same as before, but looks like we got something new on TT5!
TT5 has strong onset response to laser, looks like might be on TT6 too?
TT5 does not appear to have a sound response (maybe is inhibited by it? Hard to say). I will keep going though to see if it likes pure tones.
TT5 likes 18kHz best, but is ok with 32kHz as well. TT4 and 6 both really like 32kHz. All inhibited by white noise.
Going with 32kHz to hit all three of TT4,5,6.
TT4 laser response is gone in end, but TT5 still strong, so gonna go with another bandwidth session for TT5 (18kHz, 4Hz mod)
