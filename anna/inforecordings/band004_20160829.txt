probe:  (three-shanks), now with optical fiber!

We are recording from right AC with prodes near center of craniotomy. probes and fiber coated with DiO.

At 673um, spikes on TT1,2 and 4
Move down to 678, recorded sound and laser responeses.
TT4 definitely sound responsive and inhibited by laser pulses (not PV cell)

At 686um, thought there might be laser responses, but turns out it's just cell bouncing back from being inhibited.

At 725um, laser testing, inhibitory response again.

At 759um, laser testing, inhibitory response

At 828um, laser testing, MAYBE LASER RESPONSE ON TT6?? Doing another run of laser pulses to be sure.
TT6 cell is sound responsive, turning up laser power to 2.5 and checking again.

Moving down a tiny bit to 832 to try to pick up cell better.
Looks like definite laser responses on TT4 and 6 HELL YEAH!
Going through the motions of tuning. TT1,2,4 appear to really enjoy 22-40kHz (TT4 has particularly strong sustained response to 32kHz). TT6 really likes12-22kHz, peak at around 14kHz.
TT6 just has big onset response to AM, most sustained at 16Hz mod.

At 884um, looks like we got quite the laser response on TT2 and 6!
Looks like we may have lost the TT6 laser response, but TT2 still going strong!
Interestingly, TT2 and 6 look like they have an onset and off response to sound.
TT1,2,3 all really like 26kHz, TT4 likes 32kHz, TT6 likes 14kHz, but hates sound after.
TT6 probably has closest to a sustained response, TT2 sort of sustained at 16Hz.

At 950um, laser response once more on TT2. Sound responsive as well.
TT2 quite likes 26kHz, not very sustained response to AM, maybe a bit to 16Hz. Don't care about other tetrodes since they're NOT LASER RESPONSIVE.
