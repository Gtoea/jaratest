probe: 7752 (three-dots)

Recording from left AC, right on medial edge, though TT7/8 more lateral than TT1/2 as headstage had to be tilted to get the whole deal far enough to the right. Probes coated with DiI.

At 820um, slowly moving down. Can already see spikes on TT6 and 8, but want better ones.

At 875um, left to have lunch/allow brain to settle, come back to spikes on TT2,4,6,8!
Looks like a possible sound response on TT2 and 6.
Doesn't look like much of a laser response, either on or off. Moving on.

Moved to 900um, spikes bigger, more clear. Trying again.
Clearer sound response on TT2,6, laser off response on TT6. Booooring.

At 925um, possible new spikes on TT2 and 8.
Not much of a sound response.

At 950um, new spikes on TT7!
Sound response on TT2,6. Very strong off response on all tetrodes. Might as well record?
None of the tuning curves are particularly clear, but let's go with 13kHz, 32Hz mod.
Mouse trying really hard to scratch at left ear! However, still seeing spikes on all shanks. Anti-mouse guard is holding up for now.

At 1000um, some really nice spiking on TT2,8, decent spikes on TT4,6,7.
Sound response on TT2,4,6,8. Still just laser off responses, but the spikes are so nice and there's so many...
Going with 14kHz, 16Hz mod.
MAYBE A LASER RESPONSE ON TT8???

At 1026, new spikes on TT7, testing for laser response.
TT8 IS LASER RESPONSIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TT8 sound response not that strong, but does look responsive?
Going with 22kHz, 64Hz mod for TT8. (tuning curve on TT8 not super clear, but is responsive to 12-32 kHz)

Still a ton of spikes at 1100um, testing laser responses.
Looks like a bit of an onset laser response on TT6? Confirming with laser train.
Yes, definitely a laser onset response on TT6 (and 5 a bit too).
Rechecking laser responses after tuning curve... is that a TT2 response?
Looks like both TT2 and 6 might like 15kHz with 64Hz mod.
