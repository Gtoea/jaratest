probe: 7752 (three-dots)

Recording from right AC, middle of craniotomy. Mouse had picked sylgard out of left well AGAIN, cortex dried out, recording from other well while I try to restore left craniotomy with saline. Probes coated with DiI.

At 500um, probes initially flexed going in. Stopped flexing once we put agar in. Still going slow just to be safe.

At 530um, shitty spikes on TT6.

At 660um, decent spikes on TT6, shitty ones on TT2.

At 690um, TT6 and TT2 spikes are nicer, plus something on TT4 and 5.
No laser response.

At 720um, really nice TT6 spike.
Laser off response.

At 850, mediocre spikes on TT2,4,6.
No laser response.

At 910um, the legend of the mediocre spikes continues.
Weak laser response on TT6. Kind of looks like a sound off response on TT6? Also TT2 is sound responsive.
TT6 likes 18kHz, 16Hz mod. Laser response still there.
