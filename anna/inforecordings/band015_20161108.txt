probe: 92B1 (three-shanks)

Recording from right AC, somewhat close to lateral edge, though tall wells make it hard to see entire craniotomy. Probes coated with DiI.

At 500um, slowly moving down.

At 675um, looks like beginning of spikes on TT2, also TT5/6 might be broken.

At 775um, definite spikes on TT2, though not very big.

At 910um, decent spikes on TT2.

At 950um, testing TT2 responses.
Maybe a sound response? Could just be noise though.
Possible inhibition by laser? (SOM mouse confirmed??)
Responses not strong/interesting enough, moving on.

At 970um, looks like spikes on TT2 and 4.
Oops, I did it again. RIP laser-three-shanks.
