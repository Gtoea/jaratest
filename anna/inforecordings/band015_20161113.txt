probe: 7752 (three-dots)

Recording from left AC, lateral edge of craniotomy. Probes coated with DiI. TT5/6 flexing slightly going in, but seem fine after agar.

At 550um, going down slowly. Can already see shitty spikes on TT2.

At 850um, starting to see some half-decent spikes on TT2.

At 875um, all right spikes on TT2, testing for laser response.
No laser response at all.

At 900um, new spikes on TT2.
Ah-ha, TT2 laser response!
Kind of a TT2 sound response? Looks like we're losing the spikes there. Testing for laser again.
Laser response seems to come and go... how odd.

Moving a tiny bit deeper (910um) to try to pick up that TT2 SOM cell.
TT2 cell continues to pop in and out.

At 930um, spikes on TT2,4,6.
No laser response.

At 980um, gigantic spikes on TT2.
Off laser response.

At 995um, new big spikes on TT2,6.
Laser off response on TT2 and 6, but the spikes on T2 are so nice I'm going for it.
Alas, no sound response.

At 1025um, nice, rapid spiking on TT1,2,4,6.
Laser off responses. TT2,4 slightly sound responsive.

At 1075um, new cell on TT2,6. Pretty sure TT2 cell is PV based on spike shape.
Looks like a laser response on TT4. Attempting to inch closer to cell.

At 1080um, lowered spike threshold a bunch to try to get that elusive TT4 spike.
Nice, both TT4 and 8 have laser responses! All tetrodes also have sound responses except 4.
Both TT4 and 8 seem to like 14kHz, 4 likes 64Hz mod.
After retesting laser response, the TT8 response is gone, but now we have onsets on TT1 and 6? TT4 response also not as strong.
Luckily TT6 also likes 14kHz.

At 1150um, spikes everywhere.
Laser response on TT2,6. Strong sound response on TT2.

At 1225um, spikes continue to be everywhere.
Nothing but weird laser onset responses and laser off.

At 1260, unlimited spike works.
Some kind of laser response on TT4. Lowering spike threshold and trying again.
...I lowered the threshold so much there's a response on EVERY tetrode. Raising threshold!
TT2,3,4 have best laser responses.
Some really spooky noise on TT7/8... hope shank is OK!
