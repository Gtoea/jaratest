probe: 92B1 (three-shanks)

Recording from left AC with probes at about the center of the craniotomy, but further anterior than previous days. Probes coated with DiI.

At 500um, going down relatively slow as shank 1 was flexing a bit going on (though straightening out just as quickly).

At 800um, checked on mouse, shank 1 is flexing very heavily going in. Will give it some time to straighten, but if it doesn't, will have to pull out and choose another site.
