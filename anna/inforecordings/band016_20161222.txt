probe: 7F29 (last-hope)

Using last probe we have. Impedances are pretty high... (2-5 MOhms). Probe pretty far medial (only place all four shanks would fit), coated with DiI.

At 500um, going down slow, see spikes on TT2 and 4.
Spikes not sound responsive.

Down to 600um, spikes on TT2,4,6,8.
No sound response. (TT6 appears to respond to mouse's movement?)

At 640um, TT2 and 4 so active that I think I might be in hippocampus.
Surprisingly looks like a TT4 sound response.
No laser response.

At 700um, spikes everywhere!
Looks like a sound response on TT2.
No laser response.

At 760um, good spikes on TT4,6,8.
Maybe a sound response on TT8, and an off response on TT2 and 6?
No laser response.
Think blood might be blocking optical fiber? Turning laser power up to 2.5

At 820um, lots of spikes.
TT1 and 6 sound responsive.
Looks like weak laser off responses.

At 860um, spikes on literally every tetrode.
Strong sound responses on TT1,6,8, weird offset response on TT4.
Looks like just laser off responses, but TT4 has such an interesting response I want to record it.

At 930um, good spikes on TT5,8.
TT5 has a decent sound response.
No laser response.
Think laser just isn't reaching tissue... pulling out as this seems pointless.
