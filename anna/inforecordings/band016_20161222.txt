probe: 7F29 (last-hope)

Using last probe we have. Impedances are pretty high... (2-5 MOhms). Probe pretty far medial (only place all four shanks would fit), coated with DiI.

At 500um, going down slow, see spikes on TT2 and 4.
Spikes not sound responsive.

Down to 600um, spikes on TT2,4,6,8.
No sound response. (TT6 appears to respond to mouse's movement?)

At 640um, TT2 and 4 so active that I think I might be in hippocampus.
Surprisingly looks like a TT4 sound response.
