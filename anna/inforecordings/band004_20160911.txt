band004: 2016-09-11

probe: 92B1 (three-shanks)
Impedances pretty low again today. How odd.
Recording from left AC with probes relatively near medial edge of craniotomy. Probes coated with DiO.

Probes in at 1066um. Instantly seeing spikes on TT2,4. Frequency of spiking leads me to suspect hippocampus...
Total inhibitory response on TT4, somewhat on TT2, maybe a really weak laser response on TT6.
Testing noise response just because I suspect TT2 is hippocampus.
TT2 does appear to have a bit of a sound response. TT4 and 6 have decent sound responses. Going to try getting closer to the TT6 cell and seeing if it really is laser responsive.

At 1080um, looks like better TT6 response, may have picked something up on TT1 and 3 as well.
TT6 kinda weird... looks like it just keeps going at baseline rate, then shuts off once laser over. Two cells maybe?
TT2 and 4 have such powerful off responses to laser that I think they'd be interesting to record.
TT2,4,6 have weeeeeird sound responses... I'm recording this!
So TT6 does still appear to have some sort of laser response, though it appears there is also a non-PV cell on that tetrode.
TT6 looks broadly tuned (or multiple cells...), appears maybe one cell likes 27kHz, second likes 12kHz.
Can try both of them at 64Hz mod.

At 1200um, spikes on every tetrode! Which one do I sacrifice?? Could try going referenceless.
All tetrodes have strong off responses to laser. Not the cells I'm looking for.

At 1250um, testing laser responses again. Spikes on all tetrodes, no reference.
Still just off laser responses.

Trying my luck at 1300um, still spikes on all tetrodes, no reference.
Still off response everywhere, but TT5 looks like it might have a laser onset response?
Take tuning curve, do laser again, onset response on TT5 looks quite week, but I came this far...
TT5 doesn't even have clear tuning, so let's go with TT2 since it has the most interesting response.
7kHz, 64Hz mod.

At 1350um, spikes on all tetrodes, off responses to laser.

At 1400um, still just off responses.

No luck at 1450um.

Trying 1550um. Still nothing!

All right, doesn't look like we'll be getting more laser responses, but TT1 and TT4 have amazing spikes that get inhibitory input from PV cells, so why not?
Recording as 1575um, TT1 and 3 seem to like 12kHz (TT1 somewhat broadly tuned), unclear what TT4 likes.
12kHz, 64Hz mod.
