probe: 92B1 (three-shanks)

Recording from left AC with probes pretty close to medial edge of craniotomy. Probes coated with DiD.

Probes in at 517um, slowly going down as TT5/6 shank was flexing a bit going in.

Starting to get what looks like spikes at 750um, eases my paranoia of broken probe.

After many microns of suspicious broken-probe-like noise, finally see some spikes on TT2 at 1036um!
May be something on TT4 as well. Testing sound and laser responses.
Really hard to tell from mouse jumping every time sound plays (and casing movement artifacts), but cell does not appear to be sound responsive.
Wouldn't you know it, it's laser responsive but not sound responsive.
Going to do a tuning curve anyway (maybe it just doesn't like white noise?) It's the first laser responsive cell we've found, we gotta give it a shot!
No, this cell definitely couldn't care less about sound.

At 1125um, cells again on TT2, and some on TT4 this time. Another shank confirmed unbroken. Trying to move a bit closer to get better TT4 signal.
Moved down to 1135um, now picking something up on TT6 as well. Moved to 1140um.
Off response to laser on TT2. TT2 also sound responsive. Interesting enough to record from.
TT2 appears to favour 12kHz, looks like mostly onset responses for AM.
Ok, off response on TT2 is gone, but might as well do bandwidth since we went through trouble of collecting it...

At 1270um, cells on TT1,2,4,6 (TT1 cell maybe TT2 cell from previous site)
Off response to laser on TT2. Hard to tell if there's a sound response due to movement artifacts from mouse jumping. Maybe off sound response?
TT1 and 2 like 14-18 kHz (TT1 has a strong off response!)

At 1310um, pretty good spikes on TT2,4,6, looks like adequate ones on TT1,3.
Maybe a weak on response on TT1, good off responses on TT2,4.
TT2 might have an off response to noise.
TT2 and 4 seem to like 10kHz the best, TT4 has best response to 8Hz AM.
